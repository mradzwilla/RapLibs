Welcome to RapLibs! This app is a hybrid between MadLibs and your own personalized rap song.

The user input is queried through the RhymeBrain API (http://rhymebrain.com/en). The resulting rhyming words are then sorted by parts of speech and entered into various templates.

Give it a try at djraplibs.com!

Feel free to reach out with any suggestions or if you experienced a problem.
